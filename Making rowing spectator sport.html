<h1>How To Make Rowing a Spectator Sport</h1>

<p>Why do people watch sports that they don’t play or do themselves? Whether that is football, a widely accessible sport to both play and watch, or F1 which is highly unlikely that you would be a competitor but nonetheless has a huge fan base.</p>
<p>It could be the level of excitement. Both F1 and football have a high level of excitement. In F1 this is created by the speed, overtakes, and the not wished for but undeniably thrilling potential for a crash. On the other hand, football is a game where the possession of the ball is often changing, different styles of play clash, and as the clock ticks down the level of drama particularly in close games exponentially increases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you investigate why, you might find these sports boring there are plenty of reasons.  In F1 2022 season the winner Max Verstappen simply had not only a better car but is simply undeniably a better driver. This meant that he won practically every race with his teammate not far behind, this led to a lack of competition, drama, and ultimately excitement and I for one got bored before the season even got to the halfway point and lost interest. Similarly in football, whilst the league is often dynamic and outside of the independent matches points can mean a lot when two top teams play and the match just switches from one end to the other with no goals the spectator can feel like they wasted their time.</p>
<p>Another reason people might find sport exciting is by supporting their favourite teams. This is a huge part of football and the team you support is often ingrained in you as a child by your family or friends whether you like football or not. This level of loyalty to the teams means that spectators are more likely to watch their team every week regardless of whether they expect the match to be good or not. Similarly, and potentially more recently people have begun to take sides in F1, and it is becoming far more common to see people in the streets sporting a Mercedes racing cap or a Redbull shirt. These people will be watching the racing to support their favourite drivers and feel they can celebrate the wins with them. This level of loyalty meant that when a spectators team wins they feel a sense of pride and success with them and therefore they have a stake in the match or race so are more likely to watch.</p>
<p>So how can you apply these themes to rowing? Firstly you'd need to make the racing more exciting. Whether that is by making shorter snappier races with faster outcomes. Or by making tactics and events happen mid-race such as clashing or overtaking in head races.  You could even add in new skills such as interesting steering or obstacles. Something that was an interesting addition to the British junior rowing championships was the omnium event in which certain skills had to be displayed to gain points before the racing took place. I remember watching these events not necessarily wishing success on the athletes but due to the high potential for a capsize similar to the thrill of crashes in F1 </p>
<p>Next, it would be important to make the video streams more accessible and of higher quality but this is something that is developing over time and requires a high budget and interest prior to the investment to make it worth doing. A bit of a chicken-and-egg scenario.</p>
<p>Another important aspect would be to create a sense of competition between teams for the spectators. Make it known who the key teams are at events, and which teams are rivals regardless of ranking. As of now, the majority of spectators are people with family or friends who are racing. To increase this audience there needs to be context. The only real rivalry in rowing in the UK is Oxford vs Cambridge for the boat race, the level of hype and excitement created for this event is annually exaggerated with one team regularly being superior in the first few minutes of the boat race similar to the example of Max Verstappen above, this is simply not exciting. What could be exciting is more hype around events with more than just two prestigious universities and include classic club rivalries such as Thames vs Molesey or Leander vs Brookes. These teams will race each other throughout the year at a similar if not higher standard than the Blue boats. This leads to the concept of supporting teams. Leander already has well-established worldwide notoriety amongst rowers but what if this was spread to non-rowers? Many of the main rowing events such as Henley Royal Regatta and HORR, amongst others are live-streamed to increasingly high standards every year. If more hype was created outside of the rowing world for these events not just by organisers but by the clubs as well then these would form a great start to promoting rowing as a spectator sport that is accessible to people from the comfort of their own homes. With this in mind, it would be important for clubs to make team supporter kit accessible which would not only provide income but also promote their team to more people. Furthermore, more of an event could easily be made from the races, exaggerate rivalries, create drama, and overall give the spectators a reason to watch other than because they’re your mum!</p>
